<form (ngSubmit)="onLogin()">
  <div class="form-control">
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input 
      name="username" 
      [(ngModel)]="username" 
      type="text"
      id="username"
      placeholder="Username"
    />
  </div>
  <div class="form-control">
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input
      name="password"
      [(ngModel)]="password"
      type="password"
      id="password"
      placeholder="Password"
    />
  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Log In" />
</form>
<p>NOTE: This was just an added feature that I wanted to include because I noticed a <code>&lt;hello&gt;</code> component that displayed a name. So I decide to add a log in to dynamically set the name of the user. There is no specific combination of username and password, the fields just require some kind of text in order to login.</p>
